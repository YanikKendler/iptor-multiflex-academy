# How to run

## Database

Run these in any Terminal and make sure docker is running:

Pull the postgres container `docker pull postgres`

Run the postgres container with appropriate port and password 
`docker run --name postgres-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgresdb -p 5432:5432 -v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -d postgres`

Enter the postgres dp to execute commands inside it `docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U postgres`

`create database multiflex;`

`create user multiflex_academy with password 'R0LvkvdE5gu41s8&@x07JZ@6O29@@^';`

`alter user multiflex_academy with superuser;`
(i am aware that granting superuser is bad practice and not fit for production)

## File uploads

For file storrage its required to have the folders "uploads" adnd "processed" in the backend root.

For file uploading please download a [windows build](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) of ffmeg and place "ffmpeg.exe" and "ffmprobe.exe" in a folder called "tools" in the backend root.

## Naming

We live in a time where autocomplete is insanely good can we please write userId instead of uid

The only place where its fine to save characters is in URLS that are visible to the user like for sharing or smth
