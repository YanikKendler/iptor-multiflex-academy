 * A StreamingOutput for streaming with byte-range requests. It's expected that a MediaStreaming is
 * ran within separate threads, thus it checks whether the app is currently running through
 * {@link AppLifeCycle#isRunning()}.
 * <p>
 * When the application is expected to be terminated (isRunning() returns false), it stops the
 * current task immediately (however, it depends on the {@code BUFFER_SIZE}, it's more reactive if
 * the {@code BUFFER_SIZE} is smaller), such that it won't block the application shutdown.
